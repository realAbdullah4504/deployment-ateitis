I need you to give me a hand with something (later we arrange a PLUS of $$$ in the month. When I get back from vacation we'll see about that haha).
I need you to install the following applications on the following servers:

 Server 1: Jenkins (CI/CD Orchestrator) -- 192.168.0.1
 Server 2: SonarQube + Gitleaks + OWASP Dependency-Check (Review of
static code and dependency scanning) -- 192.168.0.3

 Server 3: GitLab (Source code repository and repository manager) -- 192.168.0.2
 Server 4: Newman + JMeter + Cypress
-- 192.168.0.11

(Respect the order for the installation).

All applications have to be deployed in docker (depending on what i request to the customer docker should already be installed).

As this is a client environment, please be very careful in the deployment.

Can you help me? I will share the VPN access with you.

this is the instruction for the configuration of the vpn.

username:ateitis
password:Ateitis.2025

these are the credentials for the vpn and also for the virtual's machines

you also ll need to have this route
route -p add 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.255.240 172.16.10.217 metric 1
