They used the “project portal” as a project and development manager... but it did everything manually. For example, the developer coded and uploaded the code to the project portal, and said to the tester do the testing. The tester downloaded the code, implemented it and tested it. Once he had the tests done, he would upload that information to the project portal.


Just look at how to integrate (if it is by api, webhook, or what) that for example if I want redmine to communicate with Jenkins and/or github.

For example, if github notifies (by some means you tell me) to redmine that it has to change the status of the project X. We need to understand how to communicate redmine with git and jenkins.
