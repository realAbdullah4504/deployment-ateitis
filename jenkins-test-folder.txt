The next thing we have to do is to create in Jenkins a new Freestyle project, called:

Cierre de etapa "Build" - Subir reportes generales - Etapa 10

This job has to be called only if it finishes correctly the Etapa 9, 
and it has to have the ability to upload to the GIT inside the folder 
“Tests” --> “YYYYY-MM-DD” --> “Build Reports”, all the reports done from JOB - Etapa 7 up to and 
including JOB - Etapa 9.  It is important that at the moment of uploading these reports, 
I change some kind of status in Git (I don't know if I should create another branch or what...but 
as you recommend it is ok).

Don't forget to document everything!
